# Data Structures in Ruby [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jhamon/ruby_data_structures.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jhamon/ruby_data_structures)

## Tech Inventory

- Ruby
- Rspec

## Description 

The purpose of this repository is for me to gain familiarity with common data
structures by TDDing my way through straightforward Ruby implementations.  I 
can't think of a better way to do that than by implementing them myself.

## Completed so far

- [Queue](lib/queue.rb)
- [LinkedList](lib/linked_list.rb)
